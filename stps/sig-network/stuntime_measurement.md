**Document Conventions:**
- **Stuntime:** VM downtime (unreachability window) during live migration - the connectivity gap from first connectivity loss to first recovery.
- **KCS:** [Knowledge Centered Support](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7031392).

### **Feature Overview**

Customers need predictable network traffic connectivity downtime during live migration. Detecting regressions in stuntime is required.
The feature defines and measures VM stuntime during live migration and establishes a baseline with a pass/fail threshold. Testing scope is defined in Section II below.

| **Review Requirements**                | [x]  | Measure network connectivity stuntime during live migration so that these values can be shared with customers per release. |          |
| **Understand Value**                   | [x]  | Network connectivity downtime measurements and their resulting values provide users a set of expectations for VM downtime during live migration and allow comparison of OCP-V with other virtualization solutions. |          |
| **Customer Use Cases**                 | [x]  | Users performing live migrations need reference values to understand expected network connectivity downtime. Users evaluating OCP-V also need stuntime data to compare with other virtualization solutions. |          |
| **Testability**                        | [x]  | Testable by measuring the time period in which network traffic is lost. |          |
| **Acceptance Criteria**                | [x]  | Measured values are published as reference data per release; they are not a formal SLA commitment across all environments and conditions. A single global threshold exists for regression detection (see Section II.1). | These values are best-effort; actual stuntime may vary across different environments. |
| **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** | [x]  | Measured stuntime will be documented in a KCS or a Red Hat blog post. |          |

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

Tests measure network connectivity stuntime during live migration. Connectivity is measured on secondary networks (Linux bridge and OVN localnet). The test scenarios reflect different migration paths and ARP/CNI behavior during migration. Since stuntime can differ depending on who initiates traffic, both traffic initiation directions will be measured. All scenarios are measured for both IPv4 and IPv6. Measurements are taken on an idle cluster with a minimal VM setup; results reflect expected stuntime under those conditions.

**Threshold policy** -
We commit initially to a single global threshold that fits all stuntime measurement scenarios. In the future, if lower granularity is needed, we can move to more specific thresholds per CNI or another grouping.

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** VM with secondary network connected to a Linux bridge:
  - Verify stuntime stays within the global threshold for the following variants:
    - IP Family: IPv4, IPv6
    - Connectivity initiator: Client (initiator), Server (listener).
    - Migration paths (relative to the node hosting the connectivity peer):
      - Initially running on the same node.
      - Initially running on different nodes, reaching the same node.
      - Always running on different nodes.
- **[P0]** VM with secondary network connected to OVN localnet:
  - Verify stuntime stays within the global threshold for the following variants:
    - IP Family: IPv4, IPv6
    - Connectivity initiator: Client (initiator), Server (listener).
    - Migration paths (relative to the node hosting the connectivity peer):
      - Initially running on the same node.
      - Initially running on different nodes, reaching the same node.
      - Always running on different nodes.

| Default pod network / masquerade                  | To save capacity, stuntime coverage is limited to the vast majority of client scenarios - secondary networks. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| Other secondary CNIs (e.g. SR-IOV, other plugins) | Stuntime coverage is limited to the vast majority of client scenarios - Linux bridge and OVN localnet. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| Worst-case SLA guarantee | The tests assert a global threshold for regression detection, but this threshold is not a public SLA commitment. These values are best-effort; Different HW, load, and network conditions may influence stuntime. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| General performance testing | Testing is scoped to a stable environment with no performance or scale focus. High-density stress testing and measuring stuntime under heavy cluster load are out of scope. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| Upgrade | These tests will not be added to the upgrade CI lane. Baseline is measured on an idle cluster; the upgrade lane runs with heavier load and is out of scope for the current epic. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| localnet over br-ex | To save team capacity, coverage focuses on the recommended configuration: dedicated NICs for VM network. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |
| Cloud / virtualized environments (AWS, etc.) | Stuntime measurement is BM-only. Localnet and bridge CNI are not supported on public cloud. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (03/2026) |

| Timeline/Schedule    | N/A                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [x]    |
| Test Coverage        | Regressions in default pod network or other CNIs (e.g. SR-IOV) may go undetected.             | Coverage limited to bridge and localnet by design. Explicit out-of-scope notes. Can be extended later if requirements change.                                                                      | [x]    |
| Test Environment     | Stuntime values may vary across environments (different labs, HW, network config); even on an idle BM, results from one setup may not reflect another. | Baseline will be derived from repeated runs on a stable BM setup; the threshold defined will be based on a multiplier to absorb variance. | [x]    |
| Untestable Aspects   | Stuntime under performance and scale conditions (high cluster load, concurrent migrations) is unknown. | Results reflect idle cluster with minimal VM setup only; explicitly out of scope.                                                                                                                  | [x]    |
| Upgrade              | A regression introduced during an OCP-V upgrade may go undetected since tests do not run in the upgrade CI lane. | The global threshold is shared between all versions; if stuntime regresses post-upgrade, it will be caught when the tests run on the new version.                                            | [x]    |
