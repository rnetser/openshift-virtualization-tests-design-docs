## **[Feature Title — SIG-Specific Scope] - Quality Engineering Plan**

### **Metadata & Tracking**

- **Feature Tracking:** [Link to the relevant feature in Jira]
- **Epic Tracking:** [Link to the SIG-specific tracking Jira Epic, if separate from the parent]
- **QE Owner(s):** [Name (@github-handle, email)]
- **SIG:** [This SIG — the one this child STP covers]

**Document Conventions (if applicable):** [Define terms specific to this SIG's scope only]

### **Feature Overview**

<!-- In child STPs: describe this SIG's scope within the parent feature.
Do NOT repeat the parent's Feature Overview. -->

[Describe what this SIG covers within the feature and why it requires separate test planning.]

---

### **I. Motivation and Requirements Review (QE Review Guidelines)**

<!-- In child STPs: this section covers only SIG-specific review items.
Feature-wide requirements, acceptance criteria, and NFRs are defined in the parent STP. -->

#### **1. Requirement & User Story Review Checklist**

- [x] **Review Requirements**
  - *SIG-specific requirements:* [List requirements this SIG owns, or "None — all requirements are in the parent STP"]

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria**
  <!-- Only list acceptance criteria specific to this SIG's scope. -->
  - [List SIG-specific acceptance criteria, or "None — all acceptance criteria are in the parent STP"]

- [x] **Testability**
  - *Note any SIG-specific requirements that are unclear or untestable:* [List or "None"]

- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
  <!-- Only list NFRs specific to this SIG's scope. If all NFRs are covered by the parent, state that. -->
  - *SIG-specific NFRs:* [List or "None — all NFRs are covered by the parent STP"]
  - *NFRs not covered and why:* [List with justification]

#### **2. Known Limitations**

<!-- List only SIG-specific limitations. Feature-wide limitations belong in the parent STP.
If none, state: "None — reviewed and confirmed with [Name/Date]." -->

- **[SIG-specific limitation]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date]

#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

- [x] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:* [SIG-specific technical concerns]

- [x] **Technology Challenges**
  - *List identified challenges:* [SIG-specific challenges]
  - *Impact on testing approach:* [Impact on this SIG's tests]

- [x] **API Extensions**
  <!-- New APIs belong in the parent STP. List here only if this SIG tests existing APIs
  in a SIG-specific way, otherwise state "N/A — see parent STP". -->
  - *List new or modified user-facing APIs:* [SIG-specific, or "N/A — see parent STP"]
  - *Testing impact:* [Impact]

- [x] **Test Environment Needs**
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [x] **Topology Considerations**
  - *Describe topology requirements:* [SIG-specific topology needs]
  - *Impact on test design:* [Impact]

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

**Testing Goals**

<!-- List only this SIG's testing goals. Feature-wide goals belong in the parent STP.
Order by priority: P0 first, then P1, then P2. -->

- **[P0]** [SIG-specific testing goal]
- **[P1]** [SIG-specific testing goal]
- **[P2]** [SIG-specific testing goal]

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

<!-- List items this SIG explicitly will not test. If something is out of scope for the
entire feature, it belongs in the parent STP — not here. -->

- **[Item]**
  - *Rationale:* [Why this SIG won't test it]
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date]

**Test Limitations**

<!-- Constraints on this SIG's testing approach. -->

- **[Test Limitation]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date]

#### **2. Test Strategy**

<!-- Mark items that this SIG will test. For items covered by the parent STP or other SIGs,
uncheck and state "Covered by parent STP" or "Covered by [SIG name]". -->
