### **I. Motivation and Requirements Review (QE Review Guidelines)**

This section documents the mandatory QE review process. The goal is to understand the feature's value,
technology, and testability before formal test planning.

#### **1. Requirement & User Story Review Checklist**

<!-- **How to complete this checklist:**
1. **Checkbox**: Mark [x] if the check is complete; if the item cannot be checked - add an explanation why in the `details` section
2. Complete the relevant, needed details for the checklist item -->

- [ ] **Review Requirements**
  <!-- Review the D/S (Downstream) requirements as defined in Jira. Understand the difference between Upstream (U/S) and D/S requirements.
  Example: "VMs must migrate without network downtime exceeding the defined threshold during node maintenance." -->
  - *List the key D/S requirements reviewed:* [Summarize requirements here]

- [ ] **Understand Value and Customer Use Cases**
  <!-- Understand why the feature matters to customers from a D/S perspective and what the real-world use cases are.
  Example: "Customers need to migrate VMs without network downtime to maintain SLA compliance during node maintenance." -->
  - *Describe the feature's value to customers:* [Describe the customer value here]
  - *List the customer use cases identified:* [List use cases here]

- [ ] **Testability**
  <!-- Confirmed requirements are **testable and unambiguous**. -->
  - *Note any requirements that are unclear or untestable:* [List unclear or untestable requirements, or "None"]

- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**
  <!-- Acceptance criteria are the specific, verifiable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete — they define *how we know it works*.
  Example: "VM migrates without network downtime exceeding 500ms", "VM deletion is blocked for non-admin users." -->
  - *List the acceptance criteria:* [Add acceptance criteria here]
  - *Note any gaps or missing criteria:* [Describe gaps, or "None"]

- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
  <!-- Confirmed coverage for NFRs, including Performance, Security, Usability, Downtime, Connectivity, Monitoring (alerts/metrics), Scalability, Portability (e.g., cloud support), and Docs.-->
  - *List applicable NFRs and their targets:* [e.g., Resource Efficiency: < 5% CPU overhead on host during feature operation, Security: RBAC enforced, Scalability: supports 500 VMs]
  - *Note any NFRs not covered and why:* [e.g., "Scalability — no test environment with 500+ VMs available", or "None"]

#### **2. Known Limitations**

The limitations are documented to ensure alignment between development, QA, and product teams.
The following are confirmed product constraints accepted before testing begins.

<!-- **Difference from Risks:** Limitations are *known facts* — confirmed constraints that are accepted before testing begins.
Risks are *uncertainties* — things that might happen and could impact testing.
Example: "Feature does not support IPv6" is a **limitation** (known, confirmed, won't change this release).
"IPv6 cluster might not be available for testing" is a **risk** (uncertain, needs a mitigation plan). -->

<!-- Document limitations in the feature itself — constraints, trade-offs, or unsupported scenarios in the product implementation.

**Examples:**
- The feature only supports YYY storage class
- Feature does not support IPv6 (only IPv4)
- No support for ARM64 architecture in this release
- The feature is incompatible with ZZZ feature

If there are no feature limitations, remove the example items and state: "None — reviewed and confirmed with [Name/Date] that no feature limitations apply for this release." -->

- **[Feature Limitation 1]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — confirms awareness and acceptance of this limitation]

- **[Feature Limitation 2]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — confirms awareness and acceptance of this limitation]

#### **3. Technology and Design Review**

<!-- **How to complete this checklist:**
1. **Checkbox**: Mark [x] if done
2. Complete the relevant, needed details for the checklist item -->

- [ ] **Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff**
  <!-- A meeting where Dev/Arch walked QE through the design, architecture, and implementation details. **Critical for identifying untestable aspects early.**-->
  - *Key takeaways and concerns:* [Summarize key points and concerns]

- [ ] **Technology Challenges**
  <!-- Identified potential testing challenges related to the underlying technology.-->
  - *List identified challenges:* [Describe challenges here]
  - *Impact on testing approach:* [Describe impact on testing]

- [ ] **API Extensions**
  <!-- Review new or modified APIs and their impact on testing. Covers both new tests for new APIs and updates to existing tests for modified APIs.
  Example: "New VirtualMachineSnapshot API v1beta2 — 3 new endpoints, 1 modified endpoint. Existing snapshot tests need updating." -->
  - *List new or modified APIs:* [Add APIs here]
  - *Testing impact:* [Describe testing impact]

- [ ] **Test Environment Needs**
  <!-- Identified whether special environment setups are needed beyond standard infrastructure.-->
  - *See environment requirements in Section II.3 and testing tools in Section II.3.1*

- [ ] **Topology Considerations**
  <!-- Evaluated multi-cluster, network topology, and architectural impacts.-->
  - *Describe topology requirements:* [Add topology requirements here]
  - *Impact on test design:* [Describe impact on test design]

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

This STP serves as the **overall roadmap for testing**, detailing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule.

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

<!-- Briefly describe what will be tested. The scope must **cover functional and non-functional requirements**.
Must ensure user stories are included and aligned to downstream user stories from Section I. -->

**Testing Goals**

<!-- Testing goals are specific, measurable objectives — they say *what* must be verified and *how* success is measured.

Define specific, measurable testing objectives for this feature using **SMART criteria**
(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
Each goal should tie back to requirements from Section I and be independently verifiable.

**How to Define Good Testing Goals:**
- **Specific**: Clearly state what will be tested (not "test the feature" but "validate VM live migration
  with SR-IOV networks")
- **Measurable**: Define quantifiable success criteria (e.g., "95% of VM migrations complete within xxx seconds")
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and timeline
- **Relevant**: Directly supports feature acceptance criteria and user stories
- **Verifiable**: Can be objectively confirmed as complete

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0**: Blocking GA - must be complete before release
- **P1**: High priority - required for full feature coverage
- **P2**: Nice-to-have - can be deferred if timeline constraints exist -->

<!-- **Example - Functional Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes successfully with new network binding plugin across
  OVN-Kubernetes and secondary networks
- **[P1]** Validate hotplug/hotunplug operations work with new storage class without VM restart
- **[P0]** Confirm RBAC permissions model correctly restricts non-admin users from accessing
  cluster-wide configuration API
- **[P2]** Validate new metrics with real-time VM performance data (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O)

**Example - Quality Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify VM live migration completes in <30 seconds for VMs with <8GB memory
  (performance baseline from VEP-XXXX)
- **[P1]** Confirm feature operates correctly in disconnected/air-gapped environments with local
  image registry
- **[P0]** Validate zero data loss during live migration under network latency up to 100ms

**Example - Integration Goals**:
- **[P0]** Verify backward compatibility: upgrade from OCP 4.19 to 4.20 preserves existing VM
  configurations without manual intervention
- **[P0]** Confirm interoperability with OpenShift Service Mesh when VMs use Istio sidecar injection
- **[P1]** Test integration with OpenShift monitoring stack: metrics appear in Prometheus,
  alerts fire correctly in Alertmanager -->

- **[P0]** [List key functional areas to be tested with priority]
- **[P1]** [List non-functional requirements to be tested with priority]
- **[P2]** [Reference specific user stories from Section I with priority]

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

The following items are explicitly Out of Scope for this test cycle and represent intentional exclusions.
No verification activities will be performed for these items, and any related issues found will not be classified as defects for this release.

<!-- **What does Out of Scope mean?**
Out of Scope items are areas where the product works, but QE has decided not to test them this cycle.
This is the most critical section in the STP — it explicitly documents the gap between what the product can do and what QE will verify.
Every item here is a conscious risk accepted by PM/Lead. If an untested area breaks in production, this section proves the decision was deliberate and agreed upon.
Each item requires PM/Lead sign-off.

**Difference from Risks:** A risk is something that *might* prevent testing — you plan to test it but it could be blocked and you provide a mitigation plan.
Out of Scope means you have *decided not to test it* — the decision is final and accepted by stakeholders.
Example: "MultiArch cluster might not be available" is a **risk**. "We will not test on bare-metal MultiArch clusters" is **out of scope**.

**Note:** Replace examples with your actual out-of-scope items. If there are no items, remove the examples and state: "None — reviewed and confirmed that all supported product functionality will be tested this cycle." -->

- **[e.g., Core OCP network functionality]**
  - *Rationale:* The core functionality is already covered by the OCP Network team; no duplication of their test effort
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date]

- **[e.g., Special guest OS coverage (e.g., Windows)]**
  - *Rationale:* Feature is expected to work with Windows guests but no explicit tests are planned; validation uses Fedora-based guests
  - *PM/Lead Agreement:* [Name/Date]

**Test Limitations**

<!-- Document limitations in the test approach — things that constrain how or what we can test, not the feature itself.
These are distinct from feature limitations (Section I.2) which describe product constraints.

**Difference from Out of Scope:** Test Limitations are constraints *imposed on QE* (e.g., no hardware, no cluster, no environment).
Out of Scope are *decisions made by QE* (e.g., we choose not to test Windows guests).
Example: "No bare-metal MultiArch cluster available" is a **test limitation** (QE can't test it even if they wanted to).
"Windows guest OS will not be tested" is **out of scope** (QE chose not to test it).

**Examples:**
- CPU xxx will not be tested due to lack of hardware
- Real integration with [Third-Party Service] cannot be tested; external calls will be mocked using static data due to access/licensing constraints
- Performance testing limited to 100 VMs due to lab capacity
- IPv6 testing constrained to single-stack due to dual-stack cluster unavailability

If there are no test limitations, remove the example items and state: "None — reviewed and confirmed that no test limitations apply for this release." -->

- **[Test Limitation 1]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — confirms awareness and acceptance of this limitation]

- **[Test Limitation 2]**
  - *Sign-off:* [Name/Date — confirms awareness and acceptance of this limitation]

#### **2. Test Strategy**

<!-- The following test strategy considerations must be reviewed and addressed. Mark [x] if applicable,
leave unchecked if not applicable (with justification in Details). Unchecked items without details
indicate incomplete review.

Note: Strategy defines *which types of testing* apply and the high-level approach. Goals (Section II.1) define the specific, measurable objectives.
Example: Strategy says "Performance testing is applicable — we will measure migration stuntime." Goals say "[P0] Verify VM stuntime during live migration is below 500ms." -->
